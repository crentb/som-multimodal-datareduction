# Minimal container that installs the package (core + dev tools) and can run the
# test suite. No GPU / deep-learning stack is needed. CI builds this image and runs
# `pytest -m "not slow"` inside it as a clean-environment smoke test.
FROM python:3.11-slim

# PyTables (the `tables` wheel) needs the HDF5 runtime; install it from apt.
# The same layer also applies Debian security updates to the packages
# inherited from the base image.
# The upstream python:*-slim tag is rebuilt on Docker's own cadence (the tag
# current when this was added was last pushed 2026-09-02), so a freshly pulled
# base image can still contain OS packages for which Debian has ALREADY
# published fixed versions. The CI container gate scans CRITICAL/HIGH with
# ignore-unfixed:true, so those already-fixed-upstream packages are exactly
# what trips it: the 2026-09-14 weekly re-scan failed on 12 findings
# (9 HIGH / 3 CRITICAL) in gzip, libpcre2-8-0, libsqlite3-0 and perl-base,
# every one of them fixed in the Debian archive but not yet in the base image.
# Upgrading here closes the window between Debian shipping a fix and Docker
# rebuilding the base, so the weekly gate stops going red each time that gap
# opens. `upgrade` (not `dist-upgrade`) keeps this to in-place version bumps
# within the stable release: no packages are added or removed.
